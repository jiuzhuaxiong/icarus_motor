REPORT:
    - figure out what is the model for speed/position vs PWM - google

    - rotations - how do you model your controller

    - position controller - revolutions
    - combining the output from position and velocity controllers - which one to choose (bing says choose the one that gives smaller output)



WHAT IS THE EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:

    - what does he mean by accuracy of 0.01 - does it mean no osciallation higher than 0.01 or the average should not deviate more than 0.01 of the target
    - what is the expected behaviour for rotation - it is rotations from the point we start, right
    - is filtering measurements correct thing to do 


FIXES TO DO PID:
    - to average velocity use all photosensors and average speed between 3 of them


MAIN BEHAVIOUR:
    - uncomment other threads - make sure you satisfy mem requirements


    - rotate home after completing a task (if needed)
    - preempt stuff if you receive input before finished execution

    - how do you detect that position control has finished


    - mutices in threads - you probably need them


REPORT:
    - velocity measurement filtering
    - derivative filtering
    - frequency of measuring velocity - no need to be higher than frequency of controller - even bad if it is higher
