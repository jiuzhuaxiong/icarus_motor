NIKOLAY:



    - figure out what is the model for speed/position vs PWM - google


    - rotations - how do you model your controller

    - velocity measure
    - position measure

    - when do you reset controller



    - position controller - revolutions
    - combining the output from position and velocity controllers - which one to choose

    - plot PID terms
    - tune controller extremely precisely



    - melody repeated

BEN:
    - parse instructions
    - integrate parser in the program
    - find out how to pass instructions to the controller using serial on linux
