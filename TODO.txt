NIKOLAY:

    - figure out what is the model for speed/position vs PWM - google

    - rotations - how do you model your controller

    - position controller - revolutions
    - combining the output from position and velocity controllers - which one to choose (bing says choose the one that gives smaller output)



WHAT IS THE EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
    - what is the expected behaviour when we receive a new input while we are executing a current taks



FIXES TO DO PID:
    - PID controller - you probably need a faster measurement rate - less than 30ms
    - plot PID terms
    - tune controller extremely precisely
    - when do you reset controller - need to do that after you get new input

BEN:
    - parse instructions
    - integrate parser in the program
    - find out how to pass instructions to the controller using serial on linux
