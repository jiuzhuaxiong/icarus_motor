REPORT:
    - figure out what is the model for speed/position vs PWM - google

    - rotations - how do you model your controller

    - position controller - revolutions
    - combining the output from position and velocity controllers - which one to choose (bing says choose the one that gives smaller output)



WHAT IS THE EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
    - what is the expected behaviour when we receive a new input while we are executing a current taks

    - what does he mean by accuracy of 0.01 - does it mean no osciallation higher than 0.01 or the average should not deviate more than 0.01 of the target
    - what is the expected behaviour for rotation - it is rotations from the point we start, right
    - is filtering measurements correct thing to do 


FIXES TO DO PID:
    - PID controller - you probably need a faster measurement rate - less than 30ms
    - plot PID terms
    - tune controller extremely precisely
    - when do you reset controller - need to do that after you get new input

    - melody repeated

    - to average velocity use all photosensors and average speed between 3 of them

PARSER:
    - print the size that the thread is using now
    - did ben test with all threads running
    - uncomment other threads - make sure you satisfy mem requirements



REPORT:
    - velocity measurement filtering
    - derivative filtering
    - frequency of measuring velocity - no need to be higher than frequency of controller - even bad if it is higher




NOW:
 - integrate parser


BEN:
    - parse instructions
    - integrate parser in the program
    - find out how to pass instructions to the controller using serial on linux
